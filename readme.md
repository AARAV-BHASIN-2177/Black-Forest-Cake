Explanation of recipe:-
Black Forest cake has multiple (usually 4) layers of chocolate sponge cake, cherries, and whipped cream.  It is frosted with whipped cream and covered with chocolate shavings and a few cherries for decoration.  Kirschwasser (cherry schnapps) is used to flavor the whipped cream.  The bottom layers of sponge cake are also brushed with Kirschwasser (cherry schnaps) to provide moisture and a little extra flavor.

There are many other ideas on how the cake originally got its name.  Some historians say that it is possible that the cake got its name from the traditional costume worn by women in the Black Forest.  The dress was black (just like the chocolate flakes), the blouse is white (like the cream), and the hat has red pom-poms that look just like cherries.  Called Schwarzw√§lder Kirschtorte in German, which means Black Forest Cherry Torte or Gateau.
